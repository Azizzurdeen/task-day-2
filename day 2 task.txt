1. Write a blog on tthe different between document & window objects?
   The window is the actual global object. The screen is the screen, it contains properties about the user's display. The document is where the DOM is.
   window is the execution context and global object for that context's JavaScript.
   document contains the DOM, initialized by parsing HTML.
   
   Window objects= Each browser tab has its own top-level window object. Each <iframe> (and deprecated <frame>) element has its own window object too, 
   nested within a parent window. Each of these windows gets its own separate global object.window always refers to window, but window.parent and window.
   top might refer to enclosing windows, giving access to other execution contexts.

   Document=Each window object has a document object to be rendered. These objects get confused in part because HTML elements are added to the global object when assigned a unique id.
   E.g., in the HTML.
                     <body>
                     <p id="Object"> This is the first paragraph.</p>
                     </body>

   Conclusion
   Window objects and Document are not the same.  the window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser.
   This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.
   The document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser.
   The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie.
